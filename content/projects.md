<!-- <p>
   Over the course of my career, I've contributed to open-source projects
   like Go, Python, LLVM, Clang, Chromium, XLA and many smaller ones. This page
   is not about those contributions, however.
</p>
<p>
   It's a showcase of projects I initiated myself and have written the vast
   majority of the code for; there are very few exceptions here - projects I
   either started together with another person, or didn't initiate but currently
   maintain - these are explicitly called out in the list.
</p>
<p>This list only includes projects above a certain size; for a more
   complete directory, please see <a href="https://github.com/eliben?tab=repositories">the list of all my public repositories</a>.

            <p><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/11/15/pycparser-v10-is-out">Originally released in 2008</a>,
               pycparser is now the most commonly used Python parser for the C
               programming language. It's used in <a href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">CFFI</a>,
               and through it in other prominent Python projects like
               <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">pycryptography</a>. The
               following are some additional uses of pycparser, taken from real user
               reports:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>C code obfuscator</li>
               <li>Front-end for various specialized C compilers</li>
               <li>Static code checker</li>
               <li>Automatic unit-test discovery</li>
               <li>Adding specialized extensions to the C programming language</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
               pycparser's input is pre-processed C source code, and its output is
               an AST data structure. It also comes with a code generator that emits
               C back from the parsed AST.
